This is a modified version of [Suika's Navigable Rivers](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1314987140), that includes some furthur modifications:

- Two new canals: Volga-Don Canal connecting Black Sea and Caspian Sea, and Rhine-Maine-Danube Canal connecting North Sea to Black Sea
- Fixs the map so that armies can still cross rivers without boats
